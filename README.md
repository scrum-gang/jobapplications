# jobapplications
Repository for the microservices which enables users to track their job applications.

Job applications can either come from a user submitting the application form of a in-house posting, or simply by tracking an external posting via our platform.

This is currently a work in progress, the [database schema can be found here](https://github.com/scrum-gang/jobapplications/wiki/Database-Design).
